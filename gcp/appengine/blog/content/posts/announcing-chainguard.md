Chainguard has recently started [publishing their security advisories in OSV](http://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/chainguard-enhances-security-with-osv-advisory-feed), and these are now feeding into the OSV.dev database. This expands OSV.devâ€™s coverage of Linux distributions, by including security advisories for [Wolfi](https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/introducing-wolfi-the-first-linux-un-distro).

This data source addition is particularly noteworthy, as it makes a direct contribution to the comprehensiveness of using OSV.dev as the data foundation for comprehensive container image scanning, an [area of focus](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner/issues/64) for the team this year.

If you are interested in working with us to contribute vulnerability data to
OSV.dev, please get in touch. Details of the process are available
[here](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-data).
