notes: This file started as a subset of the coi.gov/pl code modified for
 use in univers. The original Apache-licensed puppeteer code was used as a base,
 extracting the Ruby version handling code. That coi code was in turn
 originally based on MIT-licensed Rubygems code ported to Python.
 This has been substantially modified and enhanced to pass correctly all the
 upstream Rubygems tests and work with univers. This mixed code has been further
 updated from the Rubygems ruby code from
 https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems specifically
 lib/rubygems/version.rb and lib/rubygems/requirement.rb
