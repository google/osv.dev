The osv-scanner tool has migrated to a dedicated repository at https://github.com/google/osv-scanner to facilitate independent versioning and development [1.2]. Future development, issue tracking, and documentation will occur in the new location [1]. The migration decouples the CLI tool from the main osv.dev repository [2].
