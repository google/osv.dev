We are excited to announce that OSV has published our new service level objectives (SLOs). 
<!--more-->

Even though OSV.dev is a free resource, we know that our users rely on us for accurate, up-to-date vulnerability information and we want to provide that on a consistent basis. We will be tracking the following:  

1. Website and API availability, measured across a seven day rolling window.   
2. Website and API latency.   
3. Data freshness.  

Please refer to our [FAQ](https://osv.dev/about) for specific details.  

Performance against the SLO will be shared via a quarterly blog post, with the intention of a reporting dashboard in the future.  

Thank you for your support of this [open source](https://github.com/google/osv.dev) project. If you have any ideas or questions, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues/new).
