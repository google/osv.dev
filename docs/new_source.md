# Contributing A New Data Source

Data contributions are welcome. OSV.dev readily accepts security related records from open source projects, given they are provided in the [OSV format](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/). Publishing records to OSV is straightforward: reserve a prefix in the OSV-Schema, and then prepare and publish your data via a Git repository or other supported method. 

The step by step instructions are as follows:

- [ ] Open an [issue](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues) using the 'new data source' template.  
        
- [ ] Prepare your data \- refer to the [OSV Schema](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/) documentation for information on how to properly format the data so it can be accepted.  
        
- [ ] Create a PR to [reserve an ID prefix and define a new ecosystem](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/#id-modified-fields) ([example](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/351)). We review the records you start publishing for OSV Schema [correctness](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/tree/main/validation) and [quality](https://google.github.io/osv.dev/data_quality.html) as part of reviewing and merging this PR.

- [ ] Prepare and publish your records via a public Git repository ([example](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/osv-database/tree/master)). If this method isnâ€™t ideal, we also support publishing records through [REST API](/data/new/rest-api) or GCS buckets ([example](https://storage.googleapis.com/android-osv/)).  
        
- [ ] To support API querying, if you are contributing a new ecosystem, please create a PR to extend [purl\_helpers.py](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/osv/purl_helpers.py) and create a new ecosystem in [\_ecosystems.py](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/osv/ecosystems/_ecosystems.py). You can refer to existing examples showing how to implement support for [Semver](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/139de7b69a2ea39e2113309b3a0a47aab920ddcf/osv/ecosystems/_ecosystems.py#L45) and [non-Semver](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/pull/3430) ecosystems.  
        
- [ ] Create a PR to start [importing the records you are publishing into our test instance of OSV.dev](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/source_test.yaml) and validate everything is working as intended there.

- [ ] Create a PR to start [importing the records you are publishing into our production environment](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/blob/master/source.yaml)
