  # 1. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major,
  # minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does
  # not figure into precedence).
  #
  # Normalization: Per spec build metadata is ignored.

  # 2. Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of
  # these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch
  # versions are always compared numerically.
  #
  # Normalization: Pad the components with '0' to allow for lexical ordering of
  # numbers.

  # 3. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower
  # precedence than a normal version:
  #
  # Normalization: Attach a very long fake prerelease version that is most
  # likely to come after any real prelease version.

  # from left to right until a difference is found as follows:
  #
  # Normalization: Pad the components.
