Linux distributions often maintain their own advisories to announce fixes based on source CVEs 
and operate security trackers to monitor unfixed vulnerabilities. For example, Debian and Ubuntu 
use Debian Security Advisories (DSAs) and Ubuntu Security Notices (USNs), respectively. This is 
necessary because Linux distributions apply and backport patches, which means the impact and 
required fixes for a single upstream CVE can differ significantly across various distributions.

OSV.dev ingests data from various sources, which complicates Linux system scanning. Scanners may 
identify multiple records for the same underlying vulnerability, such as the original source 
[CVE](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/CVE-2025-27613), a distribution-specific tracker CVE (e.g., 
[UBUNTU-CVE](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/UBUNTU-CVE-2025-27613)), and the official patch (e.g., 
[USN](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/USN-7626-1)). For users trying to determine if their Linux 
VM/container is affected by a specific CVE, navigating these interconnected records can be 
confusing and hinder efforts to find the most relevant information for remediation.

After much discussion with the wider Linux community, the OSV schema introduced an 
["upstream" field late last year](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/pull/312). This 
addition aims to explicitly define the relationships between distribution-tracked and 
updated vulnerabilities/advisories and their corresponding upstream CVEs, simplifying 
vulnerability analysis and resolution. 

### Establishing relationships between records

Prior to the `upstream` addition, the OSV schema supported the `related` and `aliases` fields 
to capture various connections between vulnerabilities. 

`upstream`: This field describes advisory records that are directly addressed by the current 
record e.g. CVE-XXX is upstream of DSA-XXX  
`aliases`: This field captures alternative identifiers for a specific vulnerability, such as 
different CVE IDs, where their vulnerability and advisory are the same, where there are no 
functional differences between the records beyond their identifiers.  
`related`: This field is used to link vulnerabilities that share a common root cause or impact, 
even if they manifest differently across different software packages or versions, while not being 
an alias, upstream or downstream manifestation of another record.

Some records that once were listed in `related` have been moved to the `upstream` field to 
facilitate this change. As of time of writing, we have vulnerability records across RedHat, 
Debian, Ubuntu, Chainguard, MinimOS and SUSE supporting this change. 

### What does this mean for you?
The OSV.dev API and frontend now support this field. Querying the API returns the complete 
transitive list of upstream records, while the website further displays the hierarchy among
 the vulnerability entries.

### How does osv-scanner use this to reduce noise from the scanning report? 
We prioritize official Linux distribution advisories and notices (e.g., USN or DSA) over their 
security tracker data (e.g., UBUNTU-CVE). This is because advisories typically bundle multiple 
related issues into a single, triaged, and fixed patch. Consequently, the scanner will now 
display only the furthest downstream advisory in the final report, while corresponding upstream 
CVEs will be grouped under its ID and hidden. For instance, a USN will be shown instead of 
individual UBUNTU-CVE or CVE entries. This approach minimizes the effort of repeatedly reviewing 
the same underlying vulnerabilities, as they are ultimately addressed by a single corrective action.

Ultimately, the integration of the `upstream` field into the OSV schema offers a more unified 
and efficient approach to managing Linux distribution vulnerabilities. By clearly establishing 
the connection between upstream CVEs and downstream distribution advisories like USNs and DSAs, 
weâ€™re significantly reducing the clutter of vulnerability reports. We invite you to leverage these 
enhanced capabilities on OSV.dev and experience a clearer, more streamlined path to securing your Linux systems.
