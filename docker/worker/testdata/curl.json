In its API, an application creates \"easy handles\"\nthat are the individual handles for single transfers.\n\nlibcurl provides a function call that duplicates an easy handle called\n[curl_easy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html).\n\nIf a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the\ncookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual\ncookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific file on\ndisk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the file name as\n`none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes).\n\nSubsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a source to\nload cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from a file named\n`none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the current directory of the\nprogram using libcurl. And if using the correct file format of course."

Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be allowed to\npattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still check for `x*`,\nwhich would match even though the IDN name most likely contained nothing even\nresembling an `x`."

This is supported because of wording in the [once proposed\nto-become RFC\ndraft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-secsh-scp-sftp-ssh-uri-04)\nthat was to dictate how SFTP URLs work.\n\nDue to a bug, the handling of the tilde in SFTP path did however not only\nreplace it when it is used stand-alone as the first path element but also\nwrongly when used as a mere prefix in the first element.\n\nUsing a path like `/~2/foo` when accessing a server using the user `dan` (with\nhome directory `/home/dan`) would then quite surprisingly access the file\n`/home/dan2/foo`.\n\nThis can be taken advantage of to circumvent filtering or worse."

The `--no-clobber`\noption prevents curl from overwriting a file if it already exists, and instead\nappends a number to the name to create a new unused file name.\n\nIf curl adds a number to not \"clobber\" the output and an error occurs during\ntransfer, the remove on error logic would remove the *original* file name\nwithout the added number."

However,\ndue to a flawed check, curl wrongly also sends that same set of headers to the\nhosts that are identical to the first one but use a different port number or\nURL scheme. Contrary to expectation and intention.\n\nSending the same set of headers to a server on a different port number is a\nproblem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` or `Cookie:`\nheaders, as those headers often contain privacy sensitive information or data.\n\ncurl and libcurl have options that allow users to opt out from this check, but\nthat is not set by default."

It does\nnot work on cross protocol redirects and it does not consider different port\nnumbers to be separate hosts. This leads to curl leaking credentials to other\nservers when it follows redirects from auth protected HTTP(S) URLs to other\nprotocols and port numbers.

Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the\nserver using a clear-text network protocol.\n\nThis could happen because curl did not call and use `sscanf()` correctly when\nparsing the string provided by the application.\n\nThe previous curl security vulnerability\n[CVE-2021-22898](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2021-22898.html) is almost identical\nto this one but the fix was insufficient so this security vulnerability\nremained."

A malicious server can use\nthis in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code\nexecution in the client.\n\nOpenSSL can declare a \"new session\" for different reasons, including the\ninitial TLS handshake completion, TLS 1.2 (or earlier) renegotiation, or TLS\n1.3 client certificate requests. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for\nsession ID caching on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores pointers to the\ntransfer in-memory object for later retrieval when OpenSSL considers a new\nsession to be established.\n\nHowever, if the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused\nHTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer\nobject might be freed before the new session is established on that connection\nand then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When\nusing that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object,\nmaking it possible for a remote code execution if the server could somehow\nmanage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in memory."

The exact\namount will of course vary with platforms, compilers and other environmental\nfactors.\n\nThe content of the remote directory is not kept on the stack, so it seems hard\nfor the attacker to control exactly what data that overwrites the stack -\nhowever it remains a Denial-Of-Service vector as a malicious user who controls\na server that a libcurl-using application works with under these premises can\ntrigger a crash.\n\n(There is also a few other ways the function can be made to call itself and\ntrigger this problem.)"

When that operation is completed, libcurl remembers\nwhich connection it used for that transfer and \"easy handle\". It remembers the\nconnection using a pointer to the internal `connectdata` struct in memory.\n\nIf more transfers are then done with the same multi handle before the\nconnect-only connection is used, leading to the initial connect-only\nconnection to get closed (for example due to idle time-out) while also new\ntransfers (and connections) are setup, such a *new* connection might end up\ngetting the exact same memory address as the now closed connect-only\nconnection.\n\nIf after those operations, the application then wants to use the original\ntransfer's connect-only setup to for example use `curl_easy_send()` to send\nraw data over that connection, libcurl could **erroneously** find an existing\nconnection still being alive at the address it remembered since before even\nthough this is now a new and different connection.\n\nThe application could then accidentally send data over that connection which\nwasn't at all intended for that recipient, entirely unknowingly."

However, the check is\nflawed and doesn't properly check for when the options are used in the\nreversed order: first using `-J` and then `-i` were mistakenly accepted.\n\nThe result of this mistake was that incoming HTTP headers could overwrite a\nlocal file if one existed, as the check to avoid the local file was done first\nwhen body data was received, and due to the mistake mentioned above, it could\nalready have received and saved headers by that time.\n\nThe saved file would only get response headers added to it, as it would abort\nthe saving when the first body byte arrives.

        "details": "libcurl can be tricked to prepend a part of the password to the host name\nbefore it resolves it, potentially leaking the partial password over the\nnetwork and to the DNS server(s).\n\nlibcurl can be given a username and password for HTTP authentication when\nrequesting an HTTP resource - used for HTTP Authentication such as Basic,\nDigest, NTLM and similar. The credentials are set, either together with\n`CURLOPT_USERPWD` or separately with `CURLOPT_USERNAME` and\n`CURLOPT_PASSWORD`. Important detail: these strings are given to libcurl as\nplain C strings and they are not supposed to be URL encoded.\n\nIn addition, libcurl also allows the credentials to be set in the URL, using\nthe standard RFC 3986 format: `http://user:password@host/path`. In this case,\nthe name and password are URL encoded as that's how they appear in URLs.\n\nIf the options are set, they override the credentials set in the URL.\n\nInternally, this is handled by storing the credentials in the \"URL object\" so\nthat there is only a single set of credentials stored associated with this\nsingle URL.\n\nWhen libcurl handles a relative redirect (as opposed to an absolute URL\nredirect) for an HTTP transfer, the server is only sending a new path to the\nclient and that path is applied on to the existing URL. That \"applying\" of the\nrelative path on top of an absolute URL is done by libcurl first generating a\nfull absolute URL out of all the components it has, then it applies the\nredirect and finally it deconstructs the URL again into its separate\ncomponents.\n\nThis security vulnerability originates in the fact that curl did not correctly\nURL encode the credential data when set using one of the `curl_easy_setopt`\noptions described above. This made curl generate a badly formatted full URL\nwhen it would do a redirect and the final re-parsing of the URL would then go\nbad and wrongly consider a part of the password field to belong to the host\nname.\n\nThe wrong host name would then be used in a name resolve lookup, potentially\nleaking the host name + partial password in clear text over the network (if\nplain DNS was used) and in particular to the used DNS server(s).\n\nThe password leak is triggered if an at sign (`@`) is used in the password\nfield, like this: `passw@rd123`. If we also consider a user `dan`, curl would\ngenerate a full URL like:\n\n `https://dan:passw@rd123@example.com/path`"

It can call\n`recvfrom()` with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size\nthat was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap\nmemory is controlled by the server.\n\nThis flaw is only triggered if the TFTP server sends an `OACK` without the\n`BLKSIZE` option, when a `BLKSIZE` smaller than 512 bytes was requested by the\nTFTP client.  `OACK` is a TFTP extension and is not used by all TFTP servers.\n\nUsers choosing a smaller block size than default should be rare as the primary\nuse case for changing the size is to make it larger.\n\nIt is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet. It is most commonly used\nwithin local networks. TFTP as a protocol is always inherently insecure.\n\nThis issue was introduced by the add of the TFTP `BLKSIZE` option handling. It\nwas previously incompletely fixed by an almost identical issue called\nCVE-2019-5436."

The smaller size that is used, the larger the possible\noverflow becomes.\n\nUsers choosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the primary use\ncase for changing the size is to make it larger.\n\nIt is rare for users to use TFTP across the Internet.

On systems with a 32 bit\n`size_t`, the math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the\npassword length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer overflow usually causes\na very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very\nhuge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.\n\n(This bug is almost identical to\n[CVE-2017-8816](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2017-8816.html).)"

        "details": "curl can be fooled into writing a zero byte out of bounds.\n\nThis bug can trigger when curl is told to work on an FTP URL, with the setting\nto only issue a single CWD command (`--ftp-method singlecwd` or the libcurl\nalternative `CURLOPT_FTP_FILEMETHOD`).\n\ncurl then URL-decodes the given path, calls strlen() on the result and deducts\nthe length of the file name part to find the end of the directory within the\nbuffer. It then writes a zero byte on that index, in a buffer allocated on the\nheap.\n\nIf the directory part of the URL contains a \"%00\" sequence, the directory\nlength might end up shorter than the file name path, making the calculation\n`size_t index = directory_len - filepart_len` end up with a huge index\nvariable for where the zero byte gets stored: `heap_buffer[index] = 0`. On\nseveral architectures that huge index will wrap and work as a negative value,\nthus overwriting memory *before* the intended heap buffer.\n\nBy using different file part lengths and putting %00 in different places in\nthe URL, an attacker that can control what paths a curl-using application uses\ncan write that zero byte on different indexes."

The\nserver then responds with a 257 response containing the path, inside double\nquotes. The returned path name is then kept by libcurl for subsequent uses.\n\nDue to a flaw in the string parser for this directory name, a directory name\npassed like this but without a closing double quote would lead to libcurl not\nadding a trailing null byte to the buffer holding the name. When libcurl would\nthen later access the string, it could read beyond the allocated heap buffer\nand crash or wrongly access data beyond the buffer, thinking it was part of\nthe path.\n\nA malicious server could abuse this fact and effectively prevent libcurl-based\nclients to work with it - the PWD command is always issued on new FTP\nconnections and the mistake has a high chance of causing a segfault.\n\nThe simple fact that this issue has remained undiscovered for this long could\nsuggest that malformed PWD responses are rare in benign servers."

We could\nnot come up with a likely scenario where this could leak other users' data or\nmemory contents.\n\nAn external party registered this as a CVE with MITRE and we feel a\nresponsibility to clarify what this flaw is about. The CVE-2017-7407 issue is\nspecifically only about the `%` part of this flaw.\n\nThis flaw only exists in the command line tool."

When the function\ncompares the cert name to the connection hostname, the wildcard character is\nremoved from the cert name and the connection hostname is checked to see if it\nends with the modified cert name. This means a hostname of example.com would\nmatch a DNS SAN of `*.com`, among other variations. This approach violates\nrecommendations in RFC 6125 and could lead to MITM attacks."

The function is also used internally in numerous\nsituations.\n\nThe function doubles an allocated memory area with realloc() and allows the\nsize to wrap and become zero and when doing so realloc() returns NULL *and*\nfrees the memory - in contrary to normal realloc() fails where it only returns\nNULL - causing libcurl to free the memory *again* in the error path.\n\nSystems with 64 bit versions of the `size_t` type are not affected by this\nissue.\n\nThis behavior can be triggered using the publicly exposed function."

The curl code for parsing the second *unsigned* number did not check for a\nleading minus character, which allowed a user to specify `[1--1]` with no\ncomplaints and have the latter `-1` number get turned into the largest\nunsigned long value the system can handle. This would ultimately cause curl to\nwrite outside the dedicated heap allocated buffer after no less than 100,000\niterations, since it would have room for 5 digits but not 6.\n\n2. When the range is specified with letters, and the ending letter is left out\n`[L-]`, the code would still advance its read pointer 5 bytes even if the\nstring was just 4 bytes and end up reading outside the given buffer.\n\nThis flaw exists only in the curl tool, not in the libcurl library."

The intent being that it\nwould parse either a string with HH:MM (two digits colon two digits) or\n`HH:MM:SS` (two digits colon two digits colon two digits). If instead the\npiece of time that was sent in had the final digit cut off, thus ending with a\nsingle-digit, the date parser code would advance its read pointer one byte too\nmuch and end up reading out of bounds."

        "details": "libcurl is vulnerable to a use after free flaw.\n\nlibcurl works with easy handles using the type 'CURL *' that are objects the\napplication creates using `curl_easy_init()`. They are the handles that are all\neach associated with a single transfer at a time. libcurl also has an internal\nstruct that represents and holds most state that is related to a single\nconnection. An easy handle can hold references to one or many such connection\nstructs depending on the requested operations.\n\nWhen using libcurl's multi interface, an application performs transfers by\nadding one or more easy handles to the multi handle and then it can drive all\nthose transfers in parallel.\n\nDue to a flaw, libcurl could leave a pointer to a freed connection struct\ndangling in an easy handle that was previously added to a multi handle when\n`curl_multi_cleanup()` is called with an easy handle still added to it. This\ndoes not seem to cause any notable harm if the handle is then closed properly.\n\nHowever, if the easy handle would instead get used again with the easy\ninterface and `curl_easy_perform()` to do another transfer, it would blindly\nuse the connection struct pointer now pointing to freed memory.\n\nAn application could be made to allocate its own fake version of the connect\nstruct, fill in some data and then have the `curl_easy_perform()` call do\nsomething that clearly was not intended by the original code.\n\nFor example, this could be an application using a component or library that\nuses libcurl to do something against fixed URLs or fixed host names or with a\nset of fixed options, but using this flaw the application can then make the\ncomponent to do something completely different and unintended.\n\nPseudo code for a bad application\n\n    easy = curl_easy_init();\n    curl_easy_setopt(easy, CURLOPT_URL, \"http://example.com/\");\n\n    // --- start of code to confuse libcurl ---\n    multi = curl_multi_init();\n    curl_multi_add_handle(multi, easy);\n    curl_multi_perform(multi, &still_running);\n    curl_multi_cleanup(multi);\n\n    // --- attack code\n    allocate_fake_connection_struct()\n    fill_in_fake_connection_struct()\n\n    // ---- end of confusion code\n\n    // now this is called, it will not use example.com at all even if the\n    // option above asks for it...\n\n    curl_easy_perform(easy);\n\nThis flaw can also be exploited using libcurl bindings in other languages."

        "details": "libcurl would load Windows system DLLs in a manner that may make it vulnerable\nto a DLL hijacking (aka binary planting) attack in certain configurations.\n\nlibcurl has a unified code base that builds and runs on a multitude of\ndifferent versions of Windows. To make that possible, when libcurl is built\nwith SSPI or telnet is used, it dynamically loads some of the necessary system\nDLLs at run-time by calling `LoadLibrary()`. No path is specified for these\nDLLs.\n\nTo find a DLL when no path is specified `LoadLibrary()` follows [DLL search\norder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682586.aspx#search_order_for_desktop_applications)\nto load it. If it is a \"known DLL\" no searching is done, the system copy is\nused. If it is not a \"known DLL\": The application directory is searched first.\nThe current directory is searched next, if DLL safe search mode isn't enabled.\nThe system directory is searched next.\n\nThe 3 system DLLs libcurl loads dynamically are `security.dll`, `secur32.dll`\nand `ws2_32.dll` (a \"known DLL\" when installed). These DLLs may not be present\non some versions of Windows, which is why they are loaded\ndynamically. Depending on a number of factors outlined in the DLL search order\ndocument it may be possible for an attacker to plant a DLL of the same name in\nthe user's current directory, application directory or other directory in the\nDLL search order, thereby possibly causing it to be loaded first.\n\n**Recent versions of Windows include all 3 of those dynamically loaded system\nDLLs and also enable safe DLL search mode by default. Therefore in such a case\n`ws2_32.dll` could not be planted, and `security.dll` or `secur32.dll` could\nonly be planted in the application directory.**\n\nTo address this issue we have changed libcurl so that any system DLL it\ndynamically loads in Windows is done in the most secure way available.\n\nNote if an attacker has the ability to write new files to your application\ndirectory they can likely still plant DLLs to be loaded in any case, load-time\nor run-time. This is by design in Windows DLL loading (refer the the DLL\nsearch order doc). For example it may be possible to override DLL search paths\nby planting an app.exe.local file or possibly a fake manifest. There is\nnothing we can do to prevent against this. We advise you to guard write\npermissions on your application directory.\n\n**Also note it is may still be possible for planting attacks to be done\nagainst load-time DLLs used by libcurl and the curl tool. This is because\nWindows loads those DLLs and their dependencies without specifying a\npath. There is nothing we can do to fix this, it is endemic in the design of\nWindows. We advise you to guard write permissions on your application\ndirectory.**"

The set string is however even more importantly used by the\nlibraries to verify the server certificate, and if no \"hostname\" is set it\nwill just skip the check and successfully continue with the handshake.\n\nlibcurl would wrongly avoid using the function when the specified host name\nwas given as an IP address or when SSLv3 is used, as SNI isn't supposed to be\nused then. This then leads to that all uses of TLS oriented protocols (HTTPS,\nFTPS, IMAPS, POPS3, SMTPS, etc) will allow connections to servers with\nunverified server certificates as long as they're specified as IP addresses or\nusing SSLv3.\n\nBy tricking a libcurl-using client to use a URL with a host specified as IP\naddress only, an application could be made to connect to an impostor server or\nMan In The Middle host without noticing.\n\nNote: PolarSSL is the old name and releases of the library that nowadays is\nknown and released under the name mbedTLS."

        "details": "curl does not sanitize colons in a remote file name that is used as the local\nfile name. This may lead to a vulnerability on systems where the colon is a\nspecial path character. Currently Windows is the only OS where this\nvulnerability applies.\n\ncurl offers command line options --remote-name (also usable as `-O`) and\n`--remote-header-name` (also usable as `-J`). When both of those options are\nused together (-OJ) and the server provides a remote file name for the\ncontent, curl will write its output to that server-provided file name, as long\nas that file does not already exist. If it does exist curl will fail to write.\n\nIf both options are used together (`-OJ`) but the server does not provide a\nremote file name, or if `-O` is used without `-J`, curl will write output to a\nfile name based solely on the remote file name in the URL string provided by\nthe user, regardless of whether or not that file already exists.\n\nIn either case curl does not sanitize colons in the file name. As a result in\nWindows it is possible and unintended behavior for curl to write to a file in\nthe working directory of a drive that is not the current drive (i.e. outside\nthe current working directory), and also possible to write to a file's\nalternate data stream.\n\nFor example if curl `-OJ` and the server sends filename=f:foo curl will\nincorrectly write foo to the working directory for drive F even if drive F\nisn't the current drive. For a more detailed explanation see the 'MORE\nBACKGROUND AND EXAMPLE' section towards the end of this advisory.\n\nThough no known exploit is available for this issue at the time of the\npublication, writing one would be undemanding and could be serious depending\non the name of the file and where it ends up being written."

This was done properly for server connections already, but libcurl\nfailed to do it properly for proxy connections using NTLM.\n\nA libcurl application can easily switch user credentials used for a proxy\nconnection between two requests, and that subsequent transfer then MUST make\nlibcurl use another connection. libcurl previously failed to do so.\n\nThe effects of this flaw, is that the application could be reusing a proxy\nconnection using the previously used credentials and thus it could be given to\nor prevented access from resources that it wasn't intended to.\n\nThis problem is very similar to\n[CVE-2014-0015](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-0015.html), which was for\ndirect server connections while this is for proxy connections."

Name and\npassword. Just like all other libcurl options the credentials are sticky and\nare kept associated with the \"handle\" until something is made to change the\nsituation.\n\nFurther, libcurl offers a `curl_easy_reset()` function that resets a handle\nback to its pristine state in terms of all settable options. A reset is of\ncourse also supposed to clear the credentials. A reset is typically used to\nclear up the handle and prepare it for a new, possibly unrelated, transfer.\n\nWithin such a handle, libcurl can also store a set of previous connections in\ncase a second transfer is requested to a host name for which an existing\nconnection is already kept alive.\n\nWith this flaw present, using the handle even after a reset would make libcurl\naccidentally use those credentials in a subsequent request if done to the same\nhost name and connection as was previously accessed.\n\nAn example case would be first requesting a password protected resource from\none section of a web site, and then do a second request of a public resource\nfrom a completely different part of the site without authentication. This flaw\nwould then inadvertently leak the credentials in the second request."

In this case, the initial connection to the\nproxy is made in clear including any custom headers using the HTTP CONNECT\nmethod.\n\nWhile libcurl provides the `CURLOPT_HEADEROPT` option to allow applications to\ntell libcurl if the headers should be sent to host and the proxy or use\nseparate lists to the different destinations, it has still defaulted to\nsending the same headers to both parties for the sake of compatibility.\n\nIf the application sets a custom HTTP header with sensitive content (e.g.,\nauthentication cookies) without changing the default, the proxy, and anyone\nwho listens to the traffic between the application and the proxy, might get\naccess to those values.\n\nNote: this problem doesn't exist when using the `CURLOPT_COOKIE` option (or the\n'--cookie' option) or the HTTP auth options, which are always sent only to the\ndestination server."

This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the\ncode. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further\nauthentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.\n\nlibcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for\nre-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to\npick a connection with matching credentials only.\n\nIf a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a\nspecific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get\nre-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but\nwithout having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already\nauthenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get\nsent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.\n\nThis problem is very similar to the previous problem known as\n[CVE-2014-0015](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2014-0015.html). The main\ndifference this time is that the subsequent request that wrongly re-use a\nconnection doesn't ask for NTLM authentication."

The memory area's size is set with a separate\noption, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.\n\nAs the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately\nheld memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is\nassociated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an \"easy handle\".\n\nThis handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy,\nand all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and\nwill be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data\nto send in an HTTP POST request.\n\nThe internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to\nthe new had two problems:\n\n1. It mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string which is\n   assumed to end with a zero byte. `strdup()` was subsequently used to\n   duplicate the post data buffer, and as a post data buffer can both\n   legitimately contain a zero byte, or may not contain any zero bytes at all\n   (including a tailing one), `strdup()` could create a copy that a) was too\n   small b) was too large or c) could crash due to reading an inaccessible\n   memory area. The `strdup()` function of course allocates memory off the\n   heap.\n\n2. After duplication of the handle data, the pointer used to read from when\n   sending the data was not updated. So when sending off the post, libcurl\n   would still read from the original handle's buffer which at that time could\n   have been freed or reused for other purposes.\n\nWhen libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data\nfor the protocol body it will `memcpy()` data from that pointer using the old\nsize and the old pointer. This makes a read from the wrong place and can lead\nto libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be stored at that\nplaces in memory at that time.\n\nWe are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for\nnefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might\nalready have been exploited."

        "details": "libcurl incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal\nIP addresses.\n\nRFC 2818 covers the requirements for matching Common Names (CNs) and\nsubjectAltNames in order to establish valid SSL connections. It first\ndiscusses CNs that are for hostnames, and the rules for wildcards in this\ncase. The next paragraph in the RFC then discusses CNs that are IP addresses:\n\n'In some cases, the URI is specified as an IP address rather than a\nhostname. In this case, the `iPAddress` subjectAltName must be present in the\ncertificate and must exactly match the IP in the URI.'\n\nThe intention of the RFC is clear in that you should not be able to use\nwildcards with IP addresses (in order to avoid the ability to perform\nman-in-the-middle attacks). Unfortunately libcurl fails to adhere to this\nrule under certain conditions, and subsequently it would allow and use a\nwildcard match specified in the CN field.\n\nExploiting this flaw, a malicious server could participate in a MITM attack\nor just easier fool users that it is a legitimate site for whatever purpose,\nwhen it actually isn't.\n\nA good CA should refuse to issue a certificate with the CN as indicated,\nhowever there only need be one CA to issue one in error for this issue to\nresult in the user getting no warning at all and being vulnerable to MITM.\n\nThis flaw is only present in libcurl when built to use one out of a few\nspecific TLS libraries: OpenSSL, axTLS, qsossl or gskit.\n\nThis problem is similar to one previously reported by Richard Moore, found in\nmultiple browsers."

Due to an\nerror in the code, a transfer that was initiated by an application could\nwrongfully re-use an existing connection to the same server that was\nauthenticated using different credentials. The existing logic basically only\nworked well enough for HTTP and FTP, while all other network protocols were\nsilently, but erroneously, assumed to work like HTTP. Basically, protocols\nthat use connection oriented authentication need a new connection when new\ncredentials are used.\n\nAffected protocols include: SCP, SFTP, POP3(S), IMAP(S), SMTP(S) and\nLDAP(S).\n\nApplications can disable libcurl's re-use of connections and thus mitigate\nthis problem, by using one of the following libcurl options to alter how\nconnections are or aren't re-used: `CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT`,\n`CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS` and `CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS` (if using the\ncurl_multi API).\n\n(This problem is very similar to a problem previously reported to NTLM HTTP\nconnections, named [CVE-2014-0015](CVE-2014-0015.html))"

Due to a\nlogical error in the code, a request that was issued by an application could\nwrongfully re-use an existing connection to the same server that was\nauthenticated using different credentials. One underlying reason being that\nNTLM authenticates connections and not requests, contrary to how HTTP is\ndesigned to work and how other authentication methods work.\n\nAn application that allows NTLM and another auth method (the bug only\ntriggers if more than one auth method is asked for) to a server (that\nresponds wanting NTLM) with user1:password1 and then does another operation\nto the same server with user2:password2 (when the previous connection was\nleft alive) - the second request will re-use the same connection and since\nit'll then see that the NTLM negotiation is already made, it will just send\nthe request over that connection thinking it uses 'user2' credentials when\nit is in fact still using the connection authenticated for user1...\n\nThe set of auth methods to use is set with `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH`.\n\nTwo common auth defines in libcurl are `CURLAUTH_ANY` and `CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE`.\nBoth of them ask for NTLM and other methods and can therefore trigger this\nproblem.\n\nApplications can disable libcurl's re-use of connections and thus mitigate\nthis problem, by using one of the following libcurl options to alter how\nconnections are or aren't re-used: `CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT`,\n`CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS` and `CURLMOPT_MAX_HOST_CONNECTIONS` (if using the\ncurl_multi API)."

        "details": "libcurl is vulnerable to a case of bad checking of the input data which may\n  lead to heap corruption.\n\n  The function curl_easy_unescape() decodes URL encoded strings to raw binary\n  data. URL encoded octets are represented with %HH combinations where HH is a\n  two-digit hexadecimal number. The decoded string is written to an allocated\n  memory area that the function returns to the caller.\n\n  The function takes a source string and a length parameter, and if the length\n  provided is 0 the function will instead use strlen() to figure out how much\n  data to parse.\n\n  The \"%HH\" parser wrongly only considered the case where a zero byte would\n  terminate the input. If a length-limited buffer was passed in which ended\n  with a '%' character which was followed by two hexadecimal digits outside of\n  the buffer libcurl was allowed to parse alas without a terminating zero,\n  libcurl would still parse that sequence as well. The counter for remaining\n  data to handle would then be decreased too much and wrap to become a very\n  large integer and the copying would go on too long and the destination\n  buffer that is allocated on the heap would get overwritten.\n\n  We consider it unlikely that programs allow user-provided strings unfiltered\n  into this function. Also, only the not zero-terminated input string use case\n  is affected by this flaw. Exploiting this flaw for gain is probably possible\n  for specific circumstances but we consider the general risk for this to be\n  low.\n\n  The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it doesn't use\n  this function."

When doing so, they figured out that some servers\n  didn't work with the work-around and offered a way to disable it.\n\n  The bit used to disable the workaround was then added to the generic\n  `SSL_OP_ALL` bitmask that SSL clients may use to enable workarounds for\n  better compatibility with servers. libcurl uses the SSL_OP_ALL bitmask.\n\n  While `SSL_OP_ALL` is documented to enable \"rather harmless\" workarounds, it\n  does in this case effectively enable this security vulnerability again."

This is most common for FTP servers, but can occur with\nany protocol supported by libcurl.  Files on remote SSH servers are also\naccessible when the user has an unencrypted SSH key."
