[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) is a widely trusted, multi-ecosystem, and multi-platform tool that automates your dependency updates. Now OSV data can be used by the tool to make informed dependency decisions. To enable OSV vulnerability alerts in Renovate, follow the instructions provided in their [documentation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/#osvvulnerabilityalerts). Currently this feature is marked as experimental and Renovate is [soliciting feedback](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/20427) from users. If you enable the OSV feature, please let them know about your experience.

We are very excited to see continued community adoption of OSV. Subscribe to our [RSS feed](https://osv.dev/blog/index.xml) for updates to this integration and other community news. Thanks to Renovate for the integration!
