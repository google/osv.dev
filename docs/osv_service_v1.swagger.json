    "description": "# What is OSV?\n---\n\n### Introduction\n\nOSV is a vulnerability database for open source projects. It exposes an API that\nlets users of these projects query whether or not their versions are impacted.\n\nFor each vulnerability, we perform bisects to figure out the exact commit that\nintroduces the bug, as well the exact commit that fixes it. This is cross\nreferenced against upstream repositories to figure out the affected tags and\ncommit ranges.\n\n### How does the API work?\n\nThe API accepts a git commit hash or a version number and returns the\nlist of vulnerabilities that are present for that version.\n\n### Is there a rate limit?\n\nThere is a rate limit of 100 requests/min.\n\n### Where does the data come from?\n\nThis is currently filled with vulnerabilities found by [OSS-Fuzz] (mostly C/C++\nprojects). OSS-Fuzz is a continuous fuzzing service for open source software,\nwith over 350 open source projects integrated and has found over [25,000] bugs.\nThis will be extended in the future to\n[support other vulnerability sources](https://github.com/google/osv/issues/44).\n\nThe full list of vulnerabilities can be browsed at <https://osv.dev>.\n\n[OSS-Fuzz]: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz\n[25,000]:\u00a0https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate%20-component%3AInfra&can=1\n\n# Getting Started\n---\n\n### Before you begin\n\n1. Create a new [Cloud Platform project](https://console.developers.google.com/projectcreate).\n\n### Creating an API key\n\n1. [Create an API key](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) in the Google APIs Console.\n2. Click **Create credentials**, then select **API key**.\n3. Copy this key in clipboard and click **Close**.\n4. Set the key in a helper environment variable.\n\n```\nexport API_KEY=<paste api key from clipboard>\n```\n\n### Enable the API\n\nBefore you can make calls to this API, you need to enable it in the Cloud Platform project you created.\n1. [View this API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/api.osv.dev/overview) in the Google APIs Console.\n2. Click the **Enable** button, then wait for it to complete.\n3. You can now call the API using the API key you created!\n\n### Using the API\n\nBrowse the reference section of this site to see examples of what you can do\nwith this API and how to use it. You can use the **Try this API** tool on the\nright side of an API method page to generate a sample request.\n\nFor a quick example using curl, run:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST -d '{\"commit\": \"6879efc2c1596d11a6a6ad296f80063b558d5e0f\"}' \\\n  \"https://api.osv.dev/v1/query?key=$API_KEY\"\n```\n\n"

      "description": "## Why did you create OSV?\n\nWe created OSV to address some of the shortcomings of dealing with\nvulnerabilities in open source software.\n\nAs believers of automation, we initially built OSV for our\n[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz) service, where we needed a way to\nstore, triage and query the large numbers of open source vulnerabilities we\ndiscover in an automated fashion.\n\nWe understand that fuzzing is not the only way vulnerabilities are discovered,\nand we plan to [extend our data with other sources](https://github.com/google/osv/issues/44)\nby working with open source communities.\n\n## Who is OSV for?\n\nOSV can be used by both:\n\n- Open source consumers: By querying our API to find vulnerabilities in their\n  dependencies.\n\n- Open source maintainers: By using our bisection and triage infrastructure to\n  determine accurate affected commits and versions when a vulnerability is\n  fixed.\n\n## How does OSV compare to the existing CVE process?\n\nWe plan to aggregate existing vulnerabilities feeds (such as CVEs). OSV\ncomplements CVEs by extending them with precise vulnerability metadata and\nmaking it easier to query for them (using either package versions or commits).\n\n## Where does the data come from?\n\nCurrently, our data aggregates [thousands of vulnerabilities](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security%20-status%3AWontFix%2CDuplicate&can=1) found via fuzzing\n[380+ open source projects](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects)\nintegrated with\n[OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz). We are planning to work with the\nopen source community to\n[expand this to various package ecosystems](https://github.com/google/osv/issues/44).\n\n## How are vulnerabilities represented?\n\nAll our vulnerabilities are described in a [simple format] easily used by\nautomation tools. This format is also intended to be easily human-editable and\nused for interoperability with vulnerability sources.\n\n[simple format]: https://osv.dev/docs/#tag/vulnerability_schema\n\n## How can I help onboard a new source of data?\n\nPlease let us know of your interest via either our [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/osv/issues)\nor the [mailing list](mailto:osv-discuss@googlegroups.com).\n\nThe pipeline for this is still in progress (and open to feedback). You can\nfollow along on how this might look at at <https://github.com/google/osv/issues/44>.\n\nWe are looking for data sources that can provide:\n- Precise commit-level information on where vulnerability was introduced and where it got fixed (preferred).\n- Or a list of affected versions / tags.\n\nIf this information is not available, our infrastruture will require a reproducer\ntestcase to accurately determine this via build bisection. Our goal is to\nprovide [easy access](https://osv.dev/docs/#tag/api) to actionable\nvulnerabilities in a fully automated way.\n\n## How do you determine the introduced in / fixed in commits?\n\nWe perform bisections using the reproduction testcase and package binary to determine these values.\n\n## What does it mean when an introduced in / fixed in commit is a range?\n\nBisection may fail in some cases (e.g. build failures or reproduction flakes) and\nwe may show a narrow range \"A:B\" of commits instead of an exact commit. This means that the result lies in the range of commits from A (exclusive) to B (inclusive).\n\n## What if it's not feasible to compute the introduced in / fixed in commits?\n\nWe encourage all vulnerabilities to have reproduction steps and/or precise\ncommit level details where possible. However we understand that in some cases\nand package ecosystems this is not feasible at scale and does not provide as\nmuch value.\n\nIn these cases [Vulnerabilities] may omit the affected commit ranges and\nonly specify a list of affected versions instead.\n\n[Vulnerabilities]: https://osv.dev/docs/#tag/vulnerability_schema\n\n## Which version control systems (VCS) do you support?\n\nOur efforts are currently focused on projects that use git. Support for other\npopular version control systems will be added as we get cycles.\n\n## I'm a project maintainer. Can I edit the details of OSV entries for my project?\n\nWe are working on a way for project maintainers to edit relevant OSV vulnerabilities. Please subscribe to our [mailing list](mailto:osv-discuss@googlegroups.com) for updates on this.\n\n## Will I be able to see bugs that don\u2019t have a fix yet?\n\nWe comply with the OSS-Fuzz vulnerability disclosure policy, either 90 days from report or 30 days after a fix is checked in, whichever comes earlier. The vulnerabilities are hidden until the disclosure timeline is met.\n"
